## Usage
To open the LCA mode selector, press the analog stick on your left controller. From here you can select from four camera modes:
* `First Person` - A stabilized camera from the player's perspective
* `Selfie Stick` - Attaches a selfie-stick to your hand so you can record yourself 
* `Stationary Cam` - Adds stationary camera with a monitor on the side wherever your hand is located. You can grab and move it with either grip button. The camera will rotate to follow your head.
* `Laptop` - The laptop allows you to build paths for the camera to follow. To open the laptop, hold your left hand palm-up for a few seconds. You can:
	* Add nodes with the plus button
	* Remove the last node with the undo button
	* Play/pause the animation with the play/pause button
	* Loop the animation with the loop button
	* Speed up or slow down the animation with the speed button
	* Lock or unlock the camera from tracking the player with the lock button.

Laptop mode only works in modded lobbies because it can be used to cheat. 

## Installation
To use LCA, you will need to have [Monke Mod Manager](https://github.com/DeadlyKitten/MonkeModManager/releases) installed. Make sure to check off Utilla. Once you have installed the mod loader, download and drop the `LightsCameraAction-X.X.X.zip` file into your plugins folder, and then extract it. 

## Important notes

While *LCA* is designed to be safe to use in modded lobbies, it is important to note that using mods in any form in public lobbies can result in a ban from the game. Use *LCA* at your own risk.
